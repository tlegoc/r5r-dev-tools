# R5Reloaded dev tools

Coding mods, gamemodes and weapons on apex reloaded is hard. Especially without autocompletion.
So I made it myself

# How to build 

- Have nodejs and tsc installed
- `npm install`
- `npm run compile`
- copy the entire folder to `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.vscode\extensions\r5r-dev-tools`
- Enjoy !

# THIS ISN'T POLISHED AT ALL AND REQUIRES A LOT OF OPTIMISATION

It works well but could be better, so here's a todo list

- Struct support
- Context support (server, client, shared, ui)
- Dot completion
- Hover

Feel free to PR, I'm not perfect so my code can be improved, if you have any ideas I would gladly see what you did !
